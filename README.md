# LQR-controller-for-TWR
two-wheeled robot(TWR)  stabliziation using LQR controller

A two-wheeled robot(TWR) is modeled in linearized
state space representation and a linear quadratic regulator(LQR)
controller is employed in order to stabilize the unstable TWR
system as well as to minimize the cost index by choosing
appropriate Q and R matrices. the Luenberger observer enables
LQR controller to meet the desired specification when states are
not fully accessible in the output.
